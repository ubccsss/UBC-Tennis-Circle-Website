# UBC-Tennis-Circle-Website

### What will you be building, and how will it be used?

Get ready to revolutionize the digital face of the UBC Tennis Circle! We're building an engaging, user-centric website that goes far beyond their existing WordPress site, one that will transform how the UBC tennis community interacts. With features like interactive calendars, Showpass integration, and review posting, imagine creating a space where members can organize their own events, share photo memories, and easily connect with each other. All of this, while maintaining robust security and a connection with the club's Discord server. This project will enhance the club's online presence significantly, giving you practical coding experience and the satisfaction of influencing a thriving community. Join us in this project to broaden your skills and help shape the UBC Tennis Circle's future!

### Why is it important?

This isn't just a website revamp; it's a mission to supercharge community engagement within the UBC Tennis Circle. We're setting out to transform a traditional club experience into an interactive, engaging digital platform. The revamped website will incentivize member participation, streamline event management, and create a more fulfilling user experience. We'll be boosting not just the functionalities, but also the fun - all while ensuring a secure and safe online environment for club members to interact.

### Who are we looking for?

#### For Developers:

We don't expect you to arrive with all these skills under your belt - this program is as much about gaining practical experience as it is about applying what you already know! That said, any experience you do have in these areas will definitely work in your favor:

- **Web Development**: Familiarity with front-end and back-end technologies (think JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Angular, Vue, CSS, HTML, Node.js, Express, etc.) could be beneficial.
- **API Integrations**: Experience with integrating APIs (Showpass, social media, Discord, and others) will come in handy.
- **WordPress**: If you've got experience with WordPress, that's a bonus, but it's not a requirement.
- **Interest in Sports**: We're looking for someone who understands the club's mission, end users, and the importance of what we're building.

#### For Tech Leads:

In contrast to Developers, we expect the Tech Leads to already have a good grasp and notable experience in the skills listed above. Additionally, the following skills and experiences may also significantly boost your application.

- **User Authentication**: Understanding of privacy and security measures is key.
- **Team Leadership**: The ability to guide and coordinate a team of developers is a must.
- **UI/UX Design**: Familiarity with design principles to help guide the team in creating a user-friendly interface.
- **Scalability and Maintainability**: Understanding how to build scalable solutions and plan for future maintenance is important, especially considering the site needs to be easily managed by non-coders in the future.
